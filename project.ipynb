    "Using this dataset of NBA player stats we want to perform a regression analysis of the selected variables to help predict the on-court performance of a player (their average points scored). To do so, all non-preformance related stats, including, age,  height, weight, and draft pick will be used. The season variable will also allow player preformances to be measured throughout time and compare NBA starts from all eras and styles of the game. All of these factors were selected because of their likelihood to correlate with stronger on-court performance.\n",
